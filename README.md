1. Establishing database connection
- first we need to install pyodbc = DONE

- db server connection variables from database_OOP import database_OOP

**_WHY?_**

- In real world you do not access the database directly

- You use SQL command to establish database connection & retrieve database filed

- This data gets transferred to UI (user-interface)


`pyodbc`
Just a python library which helps you to connect to database

why are we installing it? It helps us showcase data in the console which in real time we would display on the front end
