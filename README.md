- [x] **Establishing database connection**
- [x] **Install pyodbc**
- [x] **DB server connection variables from database_OOP import database_OOP**

**_WHY?_**

- In real world you do not access the database directly

- You use SQL command to establish database connection & retrieve database filled

- This data gets transferred to UI (user-interface)


`pyodbc`
Just a python library which helps you to connect to database

- Why are we installing it? It helps us showcase data in the console which in real time we would display on the front end

Open Database Connectivity(ODBC)
- Interface by Microsoft application which allows applications to access data in database management systems using SQL as a standard for accessing the data

**CURSOR**

- control structure
- allowing us to control and manage rows of data from a response
- pointing to and managing the row
